## Notes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS

On January 19, 2023, ICANN opened voting on a global amendment to all its registry and registrar agreements. In it they defined an RDAP Ramp-Up Period of 180 days starting with the effectiveness of this amendment. 360 days after this period is defined as the WHOIS Services Sunset Date, after which it is not a requirement for registries and registrars to offer a WHOIS service and instead only an RDAP service is required. All voting thresholds were met within the 60 day voting period and the amendment was approved by the ICANN Board. The date for WHOIS Sunset for gTLDs was set as 28 January 2025.[47]

  * **We are aware of a memory leak**

  2024-02-05: The current whoisdomain has a memory leak, we are currently investigating.
  The memory leak is not relevant for short running use but when using whoisdomain in long running programs you should be aware that each query will increase its memory use.

  * This package will not support querying ip CIDR ranges or AS information
  * This was a copy of the original DanyCork 'whois'.
      * Significantly refactored in 2023.
      * The output is still compatible with DanyCork 'whois'

## Versioning

  * I will start versioning at 1.x.x
     * the second item will be YYYYMMDD,
     * the third item will start from 1 and be only used if more than one update will have to be done in one day.

Versions `1.x.x` will keep the output compatible with Danny Cork until 2024-02-03 (February 2024)

## Releases

  * Releases are avalable at: [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/whoisdomain/)

Pypi releases can be installed with:

  * `pip install whoisdomain`

## Features
  * See: [Features](docs/Features.md)

## Dependencies
  * please install also the command line "whois" of your distribution as this library parses the output of the "whois" cli command of your operating system

### Notes for Mac users
  * it has been observed that the default cli whois on Mac is showing each forward step in its output, this makes parsing the result very unreliable.
  * using a brew install whois will give in general better results.

## Docker release
  * See [Docker](docs/Docker.md)

## Usage example
  * See [Usage](docs/Usage.md)

## whoisdomain
  * the cli `whoisdomain` is  documented in [whoisdomain-cli](docs/whoisdomain-cli.md)

## ccTLD & TLD support

Most `tld's` are now autodetected via IANA root db, see the Analizer directory
and `make suggest`.

  * see the file: [tld_regexpr](./whoisdomain/tldDb/tld_regexpr.py)
  * for python use:  `whoisdomain.validTlds()`
  * for cli use `whoisdomain -S`
