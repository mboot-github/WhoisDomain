# whoisdomain

* https://pypi.org/project/whoisdomain/

A Python package for retrieving WHOIS information of DOMAIN'S ONLY.

This package will not support querying ip CIDR ranges or AS information

This is a copy of the original DanyCork 'whois'.

I will start versioning at 1.x.x where the second item will be YYYYMMDD,
the third will start from 1 and be only used if more than one update will have to be done in one day.

## Features
 * Python wrapper for the "whois" cli command of your operating system.
 * Simple interface to access parsed WHOIS data for a given domain.
 * Able to extract data for all the popular TLDs (com, org, net, biz, info, pl, jp, uk, nz,  ...).
 * Query a WHOIS server directly instead of going through an intermediate web service like many others do.
 * Works with Python >= 3.9
 * All dates as datetime objects.
 * Possibility to cache results.
 * Verbose output on stderr during debugging to see how the internal functions are doing their work
 * raise a exception on Quota ecceeded type responses
 * raise a exception on PrivateRegistry tld's where we know the tld and know we don't know anything
 * allow for optional cleaning the response before extracting information
 * optionally allow IDN's to be translated to Punycode
 * optional specify the whois command on query(...,cmd="whois") as in: https://github.com/gen1us2k/python-whois/
 * the module is now 'mypy --strict' clean
 * the module now also exports a cli command domainwhois
 * both the module and the cli now support showing the version with lib:whois.getVersion() or cli:whoisdomain -V
 * the whoisdomain can now output json data (one per domain: e.g 'whoisdomain -d google.com -j' )
 * withRedacted: bool = False has been added to query(), if set to True any redacted fields will now be shown also (also supported in the cli whoisdomain as --withRedacted)
 * a analizer directory is presend in the github repo that will be used to look for new IANA tls's currently unsupported but maching known whois servers

## Dependencies
  * please install also the command line "whois" of your distribution as this library parses the output of the "whois" cli command of your operating system

## Notes for Mac users
  * it has been observed that the default cli whois on Mac is showing each forward step in its output, this makes parsing the result very unreliable.
  * using a brew install whois will give in general better results.

## Docker
https://hub.docker.com/r/mbootgithub/whoisdomain

 * docker pull mbootgithub/whoisdomain:latest
 * docker run mbootgithub/whoisdomain -V # show version
 * docker run mbootgithub/whoisdomain -d google.com # run one domain
 * docker run mbootgithub/whoisdomain -a # run all tld
 * docker run mbootgithub/whoisdomain -d google.com -j | jq -r . # run one domains , output in json and reformat with jq
 * docker run mbootgithub/whoisdomain -d google.com -j | jq -r '.expiration_date' # output only expire date
 * docker run mbootgithub/whoisdomain -d google.com -j | jq -r '[ .expiration_date, .creation_date ]

## Usage example

A short intro into the cli whoisdomain command
```
whoisdomain
    [ -h | --usage ]
        print this text and exit

    [ -V | --Version ]
        print the build version string
        and exit

    [ -S | --SupportedTld ]
        print all known top level domains
        and exit

    [ -a | --all]
        test all existing tld currently supported
        and exit

    [ -f <filename> | --file = <filename> " ]
        use the named file to test all domains (one domain per line)
        lines starting with # or empty lines are skipped, anything after the domain is ignored
        the option can be repeated to specify more then one file
        exits after processing all the files

    [ -D <directory> | --Directory = <directory> " ]
        use the named directory, ald use all files ending in .txt as files containing domains
        files are processed as in the -f option so comments and empty lines are skipped
        the option can be repeated to specify more then one directory
        exits after processing all the dirs

    [ -d <domain> | --domain = <domain> " ]
        only analyze the given domains
        the option can be repeated to specify more domain's

    [ -v | --verbose ]
        set verbose to True,
        verbose output will be printed on stderr only

    [ -j | --json ]
        print each result as json

    [ -I | --IgnoreReturncode ]
        sets the IgnoreReturncode to True,

    [ -p | --print ]
        also print text containing the raw output of the cli whois

    [ -R | --Ruleset ]
        dump the ruleset for the requested tld and exit
        should be combined with -d to specify tld's

    [ -C <file> | --Cleanup <file> ]
        read the input file specified and run the same cleanup as in whois.query,
        then exit

    # test two domains with verbose and IgnoreReturncode
    example: whoisdomain -v -I -d meta.org -d meta.com

    # test all supported tld's with verbose and IgnoreReturncode
    example: whoisdomain -v -I -a

    # test one specific file with verbose and IgnoreReturncode
    example: whoisdomain -v -I -f tests/ok-domains.txt

    # test one specific directory with verbose and IgnoreReturncode
    example: whoisdomain -v -I -D tests

```

## ccTLD & TLD support
see the file: ./whoisdomain/tld_regexpr.py
or call lib:whoisdomain.validTlds() or cli:whoisdomain -S

## Support
 * Python 3.x is supported for x >= 9
 * Python 2.x IS NOT supported.

## Author's
  * this is a rename copy of original work done in: https://github.com/DannyCork/python-whois
  * the project is also related to the project: https://github.com/gen1us2k/python-whois
  * both seem derived from a older google.code site: https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-whois
  * aside from the original authors, many others already contributed to these repositories
  * if authors/contributors prefer to be named explicitly, they can add a line in Historical.txt

## Updates
  * 1.20230627.2 add Kenia proper whois server and known second level domains
  * 1.20230627.3 add rw tld proper whois server and second level ; restore mistakenly deleted .toml file
  * 1.20230627.3 additional kenia second level domains
  * 1.20230712.2 tld .edu now can have up to 10 nameservers; remove action on pull request
  * 1.20230717.1 add tld: com.ru, msk.ru, spb.ru  (all have a test documented), also update the tld: ru, the newlines are not needed.
  * 1.20230717.2 add option to parse partial result after timout has occurred (parse_partial_response:bool default False); this will need `stdbuf` installed otherwise it will fail
  * 1.20230718.3 fix typo in whois server hint for tld: ru
  * 1.20230720.1 add gov.tr; switch off status:available and status:free as None response, we should not interprete the result by default (we can add a option later)
  * 1.20230720.2 fix server hints for derived second level "xxx.tr", add processing "_test" hints during 'test2.py -a'
  * add external caching framework that can be overridden for use of your own caching implementation
  * renaming various vars to mak them more verbose
  * preparing for capturing all parameters in one object and parring that object around instead of many arguments in methods/functions
  * switch to json so we dont need a additional dependency in ParamContext
  * finish rework args to ParameterContext, split of domain as file
  * 1.20230803.1 frenzy refactor-release
  * 1.20230804.1 testing
  * 1.20230804.2 testing after remove of leading dot in rw second level domains
  * 1.20230804.3 simplefy cache implementation after feedback from `baderdean`
  * "more lembas bread", refactor parse and query
  * remove option to typecheck CACHE_STUB, use try/catch/exit instead, does not work when timout happens, removed ;-(
  * refactor doQuery create processWhoisDomainRequest, split of lastWhois
  * 1.20230806.1 testing done, prep new release: "more lembas bread"
  * bug found with the default timeout: if no timeout is specified the program fails: all pypi releases before 2023-07-17 yanked
  * 1.20230807.1 fix default timeout
  * add DummyCache, DBMCache, RedisCache with simple test in testCache.py, testing custom cache options
  * 1.20230811.1 ; replace type hint | with Union for py3.9 compat; switch off experimental redis tools
  * switch off 3.[6-8] minimal is 3.9 we test against
  * start working on dataContext;
  * add more \_test items; reorder parts of tld_regexpr;
  * propagate all meta domains servers as they are not inherited, testing , some domains have been retracted mboot; 2023-08-23;
  * add suggestion from baderdean to parse fr domains with more focus on ORGANISATION
  * 2023-08-24: mboot: more \_test added to tld
  * verify all \_test on whois.nic.<tld> \_test: nic.<tld> fix where needed; remove some abandoned tld's
  * build: 1.20230824.1 mboot; to combine all new tests and changes, "the galloping Chutzpah release"
  * build: 1.20230824.5 mboot; fix missing module in whl
  * restore python 3.6 test as i still use it on one remaining app with python 3.6 (make testP36)
  * finalize verification of all tld's in iana, add test where this can be auto generated from whois.nic.<tld> 2023-08-28; mboot
  * 1.20230829.1 mboot; all \_test now work, using analizer tool to verify that iana tld db web site and tl-regexpr match
  * add DEBUG to all verbose strings
  * remove tldString and dList and domain , all go via dc (dataContect) now
  * run tests and add new TODO
  * moving all TLD_RE activities to tldInfo.py, and all exported helper funcs to helpers.py
  * thinking about adding more complicated nested regex extractors to target contact info
  * start with dependency inject: parser is passed as arg
  * add cli interface to dependency inject, rightsize after test
  * finish dependency inject move Domain create outside
  * prep for other types or regex; all simple regex strings in tld_regexpr.py now need R() around them
  * use currying to make all regex strings into function cal in whoisParser.py; all regexes in tld_regexpr.py are now converted on import to function calls via R()
  * update tld: sk to use contextual extract, test with google.sk
  * add findFromToAndLookForWithFindFirst contextual search based on a previous findFirst, used in "fr" tld, example google.fr, {} is used to add to fromStr
  * experimental: 1.20230903.1 mboot , only on pypi-test
